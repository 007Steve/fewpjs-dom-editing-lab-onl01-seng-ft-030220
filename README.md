# Introduction to the DOM Lab

## Learning Goals

1. Identify that DOM nodes are written as HTML

## Introduction
We've started looking at the DOM and its structure. Now it's time to see what we
can do with it.

## Identify that DOM nodes are written as HTML
There aren't many notes in the Airtable about this lab, but it's pretty mature in the Skills course, so I'll pull it from there and update it so it's a bit more mature for this audience. 


## Conclusion

We reviewed DOM nodes and their HTML sources, and we reviewed how the DOM is
structured. We also looked at block and inline elements and their behaviors.
Finally, we practiced working directly with the DOM.
